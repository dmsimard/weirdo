About this project
------------------
Testing OpenStack_ installations is complex:

* There is almost 50 official `OpenStack projects`_
* There is over 1000 source and binary packages provided by the official RDO
  repositories
* There are countless deployment use cases from simple private clouds to large
  scale complex and highly available public clouds

Providing test coverage to make sure that each and every project and use case
works well is a hard problem to solve.

WeIRDO is an attempt to leverage the effort the community puts towards their
own CI initiative to improve the coverage that upstream RDO provides.

We're taking your jobs outside the gate to test what we ship before our
packages even make it to your CI.

Let's work together to make RDO better.
